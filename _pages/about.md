About Me
======
Hello! I am Xiangdong. I graduated from Harbin University in 2018 and obtained a Master's degree in Computer Science from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China in 2025. I worked for three years as a software engineer at DataSeed in Shanghai, and I am currently working at Baidu in Beijing, focusing on research and development in cloud computing.

My research interests include mobile edge computing, wireless communication, and developing high-performance resource allocation strategies for large-scale networks. I also have experience with deep learning, including Transformer-based generative language models, pretraining and fine-tuning, RLHF, and deep reinforcement learning. I am particularly interested in exploring high-quality small models to build intelligent edge networks, which I believe is a meaningful and promising direction.
